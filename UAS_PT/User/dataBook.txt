Like all envoys of the Ekumen, he can \"mindspeak\"â€”a form of quasi-telepathic speech, which Gethenians are capable of, but of which they are unaware.[25] He lands in the Gethenian kingdom of Karhide, and spends two years attempting to persuade the members of its government of the value of joining the Ekumen. Karhide is one of two major nations on Gethen, the other being Orgoreyn","rating":9.2,"content":"The royal party, myself among them, gather on a platform of new timbers beside the unfinished Arch of the River Gate. The occasion of the parade is the completion of that arch, which completes the new Road and River Port of Erhenrang, a great operation of dredging and building and roadmaking which has taken five years, and will distinguish Argaven XV\u0027s reign in the annals of Karhide. We are all squeezed rather tight on the platform in our damp and massive finery. The rain is gone, the sun shines on us, the splendid, radiant, traitorous sun of Winter. I remark to the person on my left, \"It\u0027s hot. It\u0027s really hot.\"","genreByGenreIdGenre":{"idGenre":2,"namaGenre":"Science Fiction"}}
